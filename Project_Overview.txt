Quantum Currency Arbitrage using QAOA (Qiskit)
===========================================

1) Project summary
------------------
This project demonstrates how to model currency arbitrage detection as a
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and solve it using
QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) with IBM Qiskit.

Currencies are represented as nodes in a directed graph and exchange rates as
weighted directed edges. A profitable arbitrage corresponds to a directed cycle
whose product of exchange rates exceeds 1.

To make the objective additive (QUBO-friendly), the model uses:
  cost(edge) = -log(rate)
Minimizing the sum of costs along a selected cycle corresponds to maximizing the
product of rates.

2) Core idea (QUBO)
-------------------
Decision variables:
  One binary variable per directed edge (trade): x_e in {0,1}

Objective:
  Minimize sum_e (-log(rate_e)) * x_e

Constraints (enforced via quadratic penalty terms):
  - Each currency has exactly one outgoing selected edge
  - Each currency has exactly one incoming selected edge
These constraints encourage valid cycle-like selections.

3) Quantum workflow (QAOA)
--------------------------
  - Build QUBO from the graph
  - Convert QUBO -> Ising Hamiltonian (Z-Pauli operator + offset)
  - Run QAOA on a simulator backend
  - Sample bitstrings and decode them back to selected edges
  - Validate whether the selected edges form a feasible cycle

4) Classical validation and interpretation
------------------------------------------
The notebook also includes baseline checks and interpretation, such as:
  - Cycle feasibility checks
  - Bellman-Ford negative-cycle detection on transformed weights (-log(rate))
  - Profit computation for a detected cycle
  - Fee sensitivity: how per-trade fees can eliminate the arbitrage

5) Files to look at
-------------------
Main implementation:
  - Code Files\Currency_Arbitrage_QAOA_Qiskit.ipynb

Script version:
  - Code Files\Qiskit.py

Dataset:
  - Data\Data-sheet.csv

Report:
  - QAOA_Qiskit_Arbitrage_Report.pdf

6) How to run
-------------
Notebook (recommended):
  - Open: Code Files\Currency_Arbitrage_QAOA_Qiskit.ipynb
  - Run cells top-to-bottom

Python script:
  - Run: python "Code Files\Qiskit.py"
  - Note: Qiskit.py currently uses an absolute path for the CSV; adjust if needed.

7) Dependencies
---------------
Tested with Python 3.10 and typical packages:
  - qiskit, qiskit-aer, qiskit-optimization, qiskit-algorithms
  - numpy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib

8) Expected outputs
-------------------
When executed you should see:
  - Graph visualization of currencies and exchange rates
  - Printed QUBO and Ising Hamiltonian details
  - QAOA sampling results (bitstrings + decoded edges)
  - Baseline arbitrage detection and profit/fee sensitivity outputs
